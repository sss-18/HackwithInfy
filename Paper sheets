Sam is given a rectangular paper having dimensions h*w, where h is the height and w is the width. 
Sam wants to fold the paper so its dimensions are h1*w1 in the minimum number of moves. 
The paper can only be folded parallel to its edges and after folding, the dimensions should be integers.

For example, given h=8 and w=4, fold the paper until it is h1, w1 = 6, 1. First fold along the long edge 6 units from a side, 
resulting in a paper that is 6*4. Next, fold along the width 2 units from the 4 unit edge to have 6*2. 
Fold along the center of the 2 unit edge to achieve a 6*1 page in three folds.
