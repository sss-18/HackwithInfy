Question -- you are given 2 strings  S and T . And  an integer no. k
            string S and T contains alphabets in lower case only.
            both are of same lengths
            your task is to convert String S to String T.
            
            rules -- 1 )  you can change any character in the string S only if the "distance" between that characters in the Strings are between 
                          the range 1 to k.
                          else : you cannot convert and print "NO"
                          
                          "distance"------diatance word means the letter gap between the characters
                                          for eg. the distance between "a" and "d" is 3 and between "x" and "a" is 3
                      2 ) you can only go in right direction.
                      3 ) the path is circular ie. after "z" comes "a".
                      4 ) you can choose a value from 1 to k multiple times
 At last print "yes" if it is possible
 else : print No
